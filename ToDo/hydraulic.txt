Smooth = 30
Damp = 50

if (Button == 1) {Distance = 130}
if (Button == 0) {Distance = 15}




#[RIGHT THEN.  YOU SEE IT HAS BUTTON AS AN INPUT?
THAT MEANS YOU MAKE A BUTTON AND WIRE THE E2 TO THE BUTTON.
THE BUTTON HAS TO HAVE AN OUTPUT OF 1 AND AN OFF OF 0.

SPAWNA SMOOTHER CHIP OR WHATEVER THE FUCK ITS CALLED.
WIRE THE A OF THAT CHIP TO THE DUSTANCE OF THE E2.

WIRE THE RATE FROM THE SMOOTHER TO THE E2'S SMOOTH.

YOU ARE NOW A TWAT. ]#
